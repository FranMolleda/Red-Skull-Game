# Process:

The first thing I did was to outline what game I wanted to develop. How many players, enemies, goal to achieve and way to finish.

Then, I analyzed how to be able put into practice what I learned previously and dividing the game into levels, to be able to put it into practice.

Having the above clear, I made a file structure that I was going to need to be able to have a code that was as clean and easy to handle when the setbacks came.

I decided to have a basic structure, following the same order in the properties of each element,in this way it helps a better understanding, both for me, and for anyone else who sees it.

I have had some difficulties, among the most notable are:

The logic to make movements of the elements.
Link different HTML files depending on what happens in the game.
Change levels and the behavior of the elements depending on the level.
With the scope at certain times.
With the handling of Git.

Acknowledgments: 

First of all, I would like to thank the TA's (especially Alejandro, who made him leave the account later and managed to remain calm before my disastrous branches, incomprehensible mistakes, pulls and meaningless pushes) for Your patience, advice and clarification.
Also to my colleagues for their help and willingness.

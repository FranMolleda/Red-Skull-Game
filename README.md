# Red Skull Game is the first project of IronHack, Module one. 


The player has to eat mosquitoes and avoid screen limits. Look at scoreboard to know  how many points you need to reach next level.

Play with arrows and space keys.

Be careful, some enemies want to kill you. 

First level: Bat Mosquito comes to catch you.
Second level: Ghosts change your gravity.
Thrid level: Bombs are moving on the floor.

# Process:

The first objective to develope this game was to think about the main structure and basic components (players, enemies, goal to achieve and way to finish)
After analyzing how to spread out previous learnings I decided to divide the game into levels in order to implementing them. 
Then I created a file structure and a common rules in the properties of each element to ensure a clean code to work easy with. 

I have had some difficulties:

How to apply the logic to make the elementÂ´s movements.
How to link different HTML files depending on what happens in the game.
How to change level and the behavior of elements depending on the level.
With the scope.
With Git`s branches.

Acknowledgments: 

First of all, I would like to thank the TA's team for their patience and good advices. Also to my colleagues for their help and willingness.
